Simple bootstrap / JS app to create a time table where each student has a unique sequence of subjects

This is a simple javascript application that creates a time table such that each student will have a different sequence of subjects. 

This little project stemmed from a situation where students could give any exam on any given day. Therefore two students could be assigned different subjects to discourage copying. However, doing this by hand and ensuring that no two students   have the same subject on the same day, so that they may not sit side by side, is tedious. This is why I created an application that can be easily deployed on almost any machine in a matter of seconds without any prior installation or some such hassle.

The reason this is all in one simple HTML file and not in a more elegant structure is because this project initially needed to be developed and deployed as quickly as possible. This is designed so that the user can deploy this on phone or on any PC in a trivial amount of time.  Since this app *generates* data but does not store or modify it, it is possible to do this.
